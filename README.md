# VerbScraper
This Chrome extension is designed to automatically scrape and turn all the verb conjugations into a JSON string using a list of user-inputted verbs, This Chrome extension uses the website https://leconjugueur.lefigaro.fr/ to collect its data by traversing its DOM and collecting the relevant information.
## Goal
This extension was created to facilitate data collection of these verbs for a future language memorization application's database (Duolingo style), and as a learning developer, learning the basics of Chrome extensions seemed like an exciting learning exercise. Maybe it's true what they say, programmers will spend hours coding just to automate a task! 

## Usage
After clicking on the extension icon use the popup to input every verb intended to be scrapped.

#### Accepted entries
- Individual verbs
- Multiple verbs separated by a comma

The multiple verbs entry is extremely helpful with automatization, enabling the use of an AI tool like chatGPT to give you a list of the most common French verbs separated by a comma and then it becomes a simple copy-and-paste task

## Functionality
The application works in 5 steps:
1. All the verbs are entered by the user and the "Get verbs" button is pressed
2. The extension service worker will receive a query Array with the verbs
3. The service worker opens a new tab with the first verb of the query and injects a script designed to scrape the necessary data, closing the tab afterward
4. Step 3 is repeated until all the verbs in the query string have been scrapped
5. When completed a results page is opened with the scrapped data as well as any possible verbs that were not scrapped for any reason.

## Scraped Data Structure

The data scrapped is an array of objects where every verb is put into its object of nested objects with the mode of the verb followed by its tense: eg. `object.indicative.present`

#### Example of data scrapped for the verb "Être" (to be)

## Possible improvements
- [ ] Improve CSS on popup (especially the delete functionalities UI)
- [ ] Possibly change data structure if necessary in the future
- [ ] Enable scraping other aspects of the language 
- [ ] Enable scrapping from other French conjugation websites

Although some improvements can be made, this project will be left archived for the foreseeable future, since it was designed to be exclusively a tool or a stepping stone into the French learning project mentioned above.
